## Motivation

After having my progress disrupted bya family emergency and sensing a lack of motivation I decided that I would create the remainder of my portfolio projects around topics that I am genuinely interested in. This led to the creation of my Skyrim inspired Restaurant Website. "The Bannered Mare".

## Technologies and dependencies

Created using Vite, React, React-Router-Dom, Bootstrap 5, and Use-Sound.

## What I would do different

I used React and Bootstrap 5 to create the site. Bootstrap is good for speeding up the front end development process, however I do not intend to use it on future projects unless required. I would instead create my own custom components, or I would use Material UI or Chakra UI components. Bootstrap has its own built in process for layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox. This functionality is useful, however I found myself fighting with default padding and styles and having to overwrite them.

# What I Learned

I cemented my knowledge of creating routes and links with react-router. React-Router makes it extremely easy to establish navigation between webpages, instead of having to clear the dom and rerender on every page transition when using vanilla JS.

Layout and styling with Bootstrap 5.

I had been spending more time focusing on Javascript, Node.js, Postgresql and other technologies recently, so this project was a good refresher on styling and layout with CSS.

I escaped tutorial hell and completed a project that was self-driven, designed, and developed.

## Features

- A Home, Menu, and Contact Page.
- A functioning navigation bar.
- Hover effects on menu items.
- A music button that plays and pauses on click.
- CSS glow and ember animation.
